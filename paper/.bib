              infant development, and delivery mode and feeding method (breast
              milk vs formula) are determinants of its composition. However, the
              importance of delivery mode beyond the first days of life is
              unknown, and studies of associations between infant feeding and
              microbiome composition have been generally limited to comparisons
              between exclusively breastfed and formula-fed infants, with little
              consideration given to combination feeding of both breast milk and
              formula. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of delivery mode
              and feeding method with infant intestinal microbiome composition
              at approximately 6 weeks of life. DESIGN, SETTING, AND
              PARTICIPANTS: Prospective observational study of 102 infants
              followed up as part of a US pregnancy cohort study. EXPOSURES:
              Delivery mode was abstracted from delivery medical records, and
              feeding method prior to the time of stool collection was
              ascertained through detailed questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOMES AND
              MEASURES: Stool microbiome composition was characterized using
              next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: There
              were 102 infants (mean gestational age, 39.7 weeks; range,
              37.1-41.9 weeks) included in this study, of whom 70 were delivered
              vaginally and 32 by cesarean delivery. In the first 6 weeks of
              life, 70 were exclusively breastfed, 26 received combination
              feeding, and 6 were exclusively formula fed. We identified
              independent associations between microbial community composition
              and both delivery mode (P< .001; Q < .001) and feeding method (P =
              .01; Q < .001). Differences in microbial community composition
              between vaginally delivered infants and infants delivered by
              cesarean birth were equivalent to or significantly larger than
              those between feeding groups (P = .003). Bacterial communities
              associated with combination feeding were more similar to those
              associated with exclusive formula feeding than exclusive
              breastfeeding (P = .002). We identified 6 individual bacterial
              genera that were differentially abundant between delivery mode and
              feeding groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The infant intestinal
              microbiome at approximately 6 weeks of age is significantly
              associated with both delivery mode and feeding method, and the
              supplementation of breast milk feeding with formula is associated
              with a microbiome composition that resembles that of infants who
              are exclusively formula fed. These results may inform feeding
              choices and shed light on the mechanisms behind the lifelong
              health consequences of delivery and infant feeding modalities.",

               antibiotics can play a life-saving role for both parents and
               infants, they also cause collateral damage to the beneficial
               bacteria that make up the host gut microbiota. This is especially
               true for infants, whose developing gut microbiota is uniquely
               sensitive to antibiotic perturbation. Emerging evidence suggests
               that disruption of these bacterial populations during this
               crucial developmental window can have long-term effects on infant
               health and development. Although most current studies have

               administration to infants or prenatal exposure to antibiotics
               administered to the mother, little is known about whether

               multitude of other bioactive factors, which can have a long-term
               impact on infant growth and development. We systematically
               searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of
               Science to synthesize evidence published between 1980 and 2022 on
               HM components and anthropometry through 2 y of age among
               term-born infants. From 9992 abstracts screened, 141 articles
               were included and categorized based on their reporting of HM
               micronutrients, macronutrients, or bioactive components.
               Bioactives including hormones, HM oligosaccharides (HMOs), and
               immunomodulatory components are reported here, based on 75
               articles from 69 unique studies reporting observations from 9980
               dyads. Research designs, milk collection strategies, sampling
               times, geographic and socioeconomic settings, reporting
               practices, and outcomes varied considerably. Meta-analyses were
               not possible because data collection times and reporting were
               inconsistent among the studies included. Few measured infant HM
               intake, adjusted for confounders, precisely captured
               breastfeeding exclusivity, or adequately described HM collection
               protocols. Only 5 studies (6\%) had high overall quality scores.
               Hormones were the most extensively examined bioactive with 46
               articles (n = 6773 dyads), compared with 13 (n = 2640 dyads) for
               HMOs and 12 (n = 1422 dyads) for immunomodulatory components. Two
               studies conducted untargeted metabolomics. Leptin and adiponectin
               demonstrated inverse associations with infant growth, although
               several studies found no associations. No consistent associations
               were found between individual HMOs and infant growth outcomes.
               Among immunomodulatory components in HM, IL-6 demonstrated
               inverse relationships with infant growth. Current research on HM
               bioactives is largely inconclusive and is insufficient to address
               the complex composition of HM. Future research should ideally
               capture HM intake, use biologically relevant anthropometrics, and
               integrate components across categories, embracing a systems
               biology approach to better understand how HM components work
               independently and synergistically to influence infant growth.",

               disorders that involve immunological underpinnings. Cesarean
               section (CS)-born babies show altered microbiota development in
               relation to babies born vaginally. Here we present the first
               statistically powered longitudinal study to determine the effect
               of restoring exposure to maternal vaginal fluids after CS birth.
               METHODS: Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we followed the
               microbial trajectories of multiple body sites in 177 babies over
               the first year of life; 98 were born vaginally, and 79 were born
               by CS, of whom 30 were swabbed with a maternal vaginal gauze
               right after birth. FINDINGS: Compositional tensor factorization
               analysis confirmed that microbiota trajectories of exposed
               CS-born babies aligned more closely with that of vaginally born
               babies. Interestingly, the majority of amplicon sequence variants
               from maternal vaginal microbiomes on the day of birth were shared
               with other maternal sites, in contrast to non-pregnant women from
               the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) study. CONCLUSIONS: The
               results of this observational study prompt urgent randomized
               clinical trials to test whether microbial restoration reduces the
               increased disease risk associated with CS birth and the
               underlying mechanisms. It also provides evidence of the
               pluripotential nature of maternal vaginal fluids to provide
               pioneer bacterial colonizers for the newborn body sites. This is

               that these differences stem from lack of exposure to the maternal

               increasingly being utilized to characterize complex metabolic
               changes in biological samples. However, in order to achieve broad
               metabolite coverage, it is necessary to employ more than one
               analytical platform, typically requiring multiple sample
               preparation protocols. In an effort to improve analytical
               efficiency and retain comprehensive coverage of the metabolome, a
               new extraction methodology was developed that successfully
               retains metabolites from BM in a single-phase using an optimized
               methyl-tert-butyl ether solvent system. We conducted this
               single-phase extraction procedure on a representative pool of BM,
               and characterized the metabolic composition using LC-QTOF-MS and
               GC-Q-MS for polar and lipidic metabolites. To ensure that the
               extraction method was reproducible and fit-for-purpose, the
               analytical procedure was evaluated on both platforms using 18
               metabolites selected to cover a range of chromatographic
               retention times and biochemical classes. Having validated the
               method, the metabolic signature of BM composition was mapped as a
               metabolic reaction network highlighting interconnected biological
               pathways and showing that the LC-MS and GC-MS platforms targeted
               largely different domains of the network. Subsequently, the same
               protocol was applied to ascertain compositional differences
               between BM at week 1 (n = 10) and 4 weeks (n = 9) post-partum.
               This single-phase approach is more efficient in terms of time,
               simplicity, cost, and sample volume than the existing two-phase
               methods and will be suited to high-throughput metabolic profiling

               multi-omics analysis of a diverse set of 880 microbial community
               samples collected for the Earth Microbiome Project. We include
               amplicon (16S, 18S, ITS) and shotgun metagenomic sequence data,
               and untargeted metabolomics data (liquid chromatography-tandem

               used standardized protocols and analytical methods to

               incorporating additional studies, enabling the expansion of
               existing knowledge in the form of an evolving community resource.
               We demonstrate the utility of this database by testing the
               hypothesis that every microbe and metabolite is everywhere but
               the environment selects. Our results show that metabolite
               diversity exhibits turnover and nestedness related to both
               microbial communities and the environment, whereas the relative
               abundances of microbially related metabolites vary and co-occur
               with specific microbial consortia in a habitat-specific manner.

               are potentially mediated by the perturbation of the colonization
               of the infant gut microbiota2. However, the effects of delivery
               via caesarean section on the earliest stages of the acquisition
               and development of the gut microbiota, during the neonatal period
               (≤1 month), remain controversial3,4. Here we report the disrupted
               transmission of maternal Bacteroides strains, and high-level
               colonization by opportunistic pathogens associated with the
               hospital environment (including Enterococcus, Enterobacter and
               Klebsiella species), in babies delivered by caesarean section.
               These effects were also seen, to a lesser extent, in vaginally
               delivered babies whose mothers underwent antibiotic prophylaxis
               and in babies who were not breastfed during the neonatal period.
               We applied longitudinal sampling and whole-genome shotgun
               metagenomic analysis to 1,679 gut microbiota samples (taken at
               several time points during the neonatal period, and in infancy)
               from 596 full-term babies born in UK hospitals; for a subset of
               these babies, we collected additional matched samples from
               mothers (175 mothers paired with 178 babies). This analysis
               demonstrates that the mode of delivery is a significant factor
               that affects the composition of the gut microbiota throughout the
               neonatal period, and into infancy. Matched large-scale culturing

               antimicrobial resistance in opportunistic pathogens that may
               predispose individuals to opportunistic infections. Our findings
               highlight the critical role of the local environment in
               establishing the gut microbiota in very early life, and identify
               colonization with antimicrobial-resistance-containing

               performed a 2.5-y case study of the assembly of the human infant
               gut microbiome, to relate life events to microbiome composition
               and function. Sixty fecal samples were collected from a healthy
               infant along with a diary of diet and health status. Analysis of
               >300,000 16S rRNA genes indicated that the phylogenetic diversity
               of the microbiome increased gradually over time and that changes
               in community composition conformed to a smooth temporal gradient.
               In contrast, major taxonomic groups showed abrupt shifts in
               abundance corresponding to changes in diet or health. Community
               assembly was nonrandom: we observed discrete steps of bacterial
               succession punctuated by life events. Furthermore, analysis of ≈
               500,000 DNA metagenomic reads from 12 fecal samples revealed that
               the earliest microbiome was enriched in genes facilitating

               life events; however, additional experiments ought to be

               delivery mode shapes the microbiota's establishment and,

               focused on specific bacterial taxa or on a single body habitat,

               development remains obscure. The goal of the present study was to
               obtain a community-wide perspective on the influence of delivery
               mode and body habitat on the neonate's first microbiota. We used
               multiplexed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to characterize
               bacterial communities from mothers and their newborn babies, four
               born vaginally and six born via Cesarean section. Mothers' skin,
               oral mucosa, and vagina were sampled 1 h before delivery, and
               neonates' skin, oral mucosa, and nasopharyngeal aspirate were
               sampled <5 min, and meconium <24 h, after delivery. We found that
               in direct contrast to the highly differentiated communities of
               their mothers, neonates harbored bacterial communities that were
               undifferentiated across multiple body habitats, regardless of
               delivery mode. Our results also show that vaginally delivered
               infants acquired bacterial communities resembling their own
               mother's vaginal microbiota, dominated by Lactobacillus,
               Prevotella, or Sneathia spp., and C-section infants harbored
               bacterial communities similar to those found on the skin surface,
               dominated by Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and
               Propionibacterium spp. These findings establish an important

  abstract  = "MOTIVATION: Phylogenetic placement of a query sequence on a
               backbone tree is increasingly used across biomedical sciences to
               identify the content of a sample from its DNA content. The
               accuracy of such analyses depends on the density of the backbone
               tree, making it crucial that placement methods scale to very
               large trees. Moreover, a new paradigm has been recently proposed
               to place sequences on the species tree using single-gene data.
               The goal is to better characterize the samples and to enable
               combined analyses of marker-gene (e.g., 16S rRNA gene amplicon)
               and genome-wide data. The recent method DEPP enables performing
               such analyses using metric learning. However, metric learning is
               hampered by a need to compute and save a quadratically growing
               matrix of pairwise distances during training. Thus, the training
               phase of DEPP does not scale to more than roughly 10 000 backbone
               species, a problem that we faced when trying to use our recently
               released Greengenes2 (GG2) reference tree containing 331 270
               species. RESULTS: This paper explores divide-and-conquer for
               training ensembles of DEPP models, culminating in a method called
               C-DEPP. While divide-and-conquer has been extensively used in
               phylogenetics, applying divide-and-conquer to data-hungry
               machine-learning methods needs nuance. C-DEPP uses carefully
               crafted techniques to enable quasi-linear scaling while
               maintaining accuracy. C-DEPP enables placing 20 million 16S
               fragments on the GG2 reference tree in 41 h of computation.

               essential to providing clean data for downstream analysis.
               Traditionally, a different tool is used for each operation, such
               as quality control, adapter trimming and quality filtering. These
               tools are often insufficiently fast as most are developed using
               high-level programming languages (e.g. Python and Java) and
               provide limited multi-threading support. Reading and loading data
               multiple times also renders preprocessing slow and I/O
               inefficient. Results: We developed fastp as an ultra-fast FASTQ
               preprocessor with useful quality control and data-filtering
               features. It can perform quality control, adapter trimming,
               quality filtering, per-read quality pruning and many other
               operations with a single scan of the FASTQ data. This tool is
               developed in C++ and has multi-threading support. Based on our
               evaluation, fastp is 2-5 times faster than other FASTQ

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are complex
               glycans that are highly abundant in human milk. While over 150
               HMOs have been identified, it is unknown how individual HMOs
               change in concentration over 24 months of lactation. OBJECTIVES:
               To understand how HMO concentrations change over 24 months of
               lactation. METHODS: Breast milk samples were collected from
               participants in a longitudinal cohort study of Hispanic
               mother-infant pairs at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postpartum.
               Concentrations of 19 of the most abundant HMOs were measured
               using HPLC. Because the parent study is ongoing and not all
               participants have finished all time points yet, the sample sizes
               ranged per time point (n = 207 at 1 month; n = 109 at 6 months; n
               = 83 at 12 months; n = 59 at 18 months; and n = 28 at 24 months).
               Approximately 88\% of participants were classified as HMO
               secretors-a genetic factor that affects concentrations of HMOs
               such as 2'fucosyllactose (2'FL) and lacto-N-fucopentaose I-while
               the remaining 12\% were classified as nonsecretors. Mixed models
               were used to examine changes in HMO concentrations and relative
               abundances over the course of lactation. RESULTS: The majority of
               HMOs significantly decreased in concentration over the course of
               lactation. The exceptions were 2'FL, sialyl-lacto-N-tetraose b,
               and disialyl-lacto-N-tetraose, which did not change with time,
               and 3-fucosyllactose (3FL) and 3'-sialyllactose (3'SL), which
               significantly increased. The concentration of 3FL increased
               10-fold, from 195 (IQR 138-415) μg/mL at 1 month to 1930
               (1100-2630) μg/mL at 24 months, while 3'SL increased 2-fold, from
               277 (198-377) μg/mL to 568 (448-708) μg/mL over the same time
               period. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that HMOs do not
               decrease in concentration uniformly across lactation. In
               particular, 3FL and 3'SL increased over the course of lactation
               in this cohort. Future studies are required to fully understand
               the functions of these HMOs.",

               human milk (postpartum 1-24 wk) by ultra-performance liquid
               chromatography-triple quadruple mass spectrometry (UPLC-TQ-MS)
               analysis. We supplemented neonatal C57BL/6J mice of both sexes
               with vehicle (control), 5 mg/(kg · day) ODA (L-ODA), or 25 mg/(kg
               · day) ODA (H-ODA) throughout suckling by oral gavage. After
               weaning, the Morris water maze test and novel object recognition

               dentate gyrus (DG) region, and hippocampal expression of synaptic
               markers were analyzed. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and
               repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: ODA (0.566-1.31 mg/L) was the
               most abundant FAM in breast milk, followed by palmitamide
               (0.135-0.269 mg/L) and linoleamide (0.046-0.242 mg/L). Compared
               with the control group, the H-ODA group demonstrated shorter
               escape latency, shorter travel distance, 113\% more platform
               crossing, and 48\% greater discrimination index in behavioral
               tests (P < 0.05). Additionally, the H-ODA group showed a higher
               density of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU)+ and EdU+\&
               doublecortin (DCX)+ cells (62\% and 53\%, respectively), and 52\%
               greater spine density in the DG region than the control group (P
               < 0.05). The synaptic markers, postsynaptic density protein 95
               (PSD95) and synaptophysin (SYP), were upregulated in the H-ODA
               group compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The L-ODA group
               also showed shorter escape latency in behavioral tests and 27\%
               greater spine density in the DG region than the control group (P
               < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ODA is the most common FAM in human milk.
               ODA supplementation during suckling promotes learning and
               memory-related abilities in adolescent mice by augmenting

               lactation. Yet, the extent to which HMOs vary over the short term
               (days) and in response to acute factors such as maternal diet is
               unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine
               the stability of HMO concentrations over 7 d and in response to a
               standard meal and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) over 6 h.
               METHODS: In this ancillary study, lactating mothers were enrolled
               at 6 wk postpartum. Participants received in-person instructions
               and materials to complete procedures at home. In the 1-wk

               consumed a standard meal plus SSB provided by the study team.
               Mothers pumped a milk sample every hour for 6 consecutive hours.

               widely studied HMOs in relation to infant health:
               2'-fucosyllactose (2'FL) [F(2,17) = 0.39, P = 0.65],
               disialyl-lacto-N-tetraose (DSLNT) [F(4, 37) = 0.60, P = 0.66],
               and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) [F(3, 32) = 1.5, P = 0.23].
               Concentrations of all assayed HMOs were stable in response to a
               standard meal plus SSB. For example, fasted baseline
               concentrations of 2'FL, DSLNT, and LNnT were 2310 ± 1620 μg/mL,
               560 ± 290 μg/mL, and 630 ± 290 μg/mL, respectively, and there
               were no changes in 2'FL [F(4, 119) = 1.9, P = 0.13], DSLNT [F(4,
               136) = 0.39, P = 0.83], and LNnT [F(4, 120) = 0.64, P = 0.63]
               over 6 consecutive hours. CONCLUSIONS: HMO concentrations are

               features' associations with variation along a given axis in a

               'rankings' as a starting point for exploring the log-ratios of
               particularly high- or low-ranked features, such exploratory

               the rank plot (through highlighting selected features) and the

               microbiota and its metabolites regulate neurodevelopment and
               cognitive functioning via a bi-directional communication system
               known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). RECENT FINDINGS:
               The MGBA influences brain development and function via the
               hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the vagal nerve, immune signaling,
               bacterial production of neurotransmitters, and microbial
               metabolites like short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan derivatives,
               and bile acids. Animal studies show fetal neurodevelopment is
               mediated by maternal microbiota derivatives, immune activation,
               and diet. Furthermore, manipulation of the microbiota during
               critical windows of development, like antibiotic exposure and
               fecal microbiota transplantation, can affect cognitive
               functioning and behavior in mice. Evidence from human studies,
               particularly in preterm infants, also suggests that a disrupted
               gut microbiota colonization may negatively affect
               neurodevelopment. Early microbial signatures were linked to
               favorable and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. SUMMARY: The
               link between the gut microbiota and the brain is evident. Future
               studies, including experimental studies, larger participant
               cohort studies with longitudinal analyses of microbes, their
               metabolites, and neurotransmitters, and randomized controlled
               trials are warranted to further elucidate the mechanisms of the
               MGBA. Identification of early, predictive microbial markers could
               pave the way for the development of novel early microbiota-based
               intervention strategies, such as targeted probiotics, and vaginal
               or fecal microbiota transplantation, aimed at improving infant

               susceptibility to infectious agents is largely unexplored. The
               skin harbors diverse bacterial species that may promote or
               antagonize the growth of an invading pathogen. We developed a
               human infection model for Haemophilus ducreyi in which human
               volunteers are inoculated on the upper arm. After inoculation,
               papules form and either spontaneously resolve or progress to
               pustules. To examine the role of the skin microbiota in the
               outcome of H. ducreyi infection, we analyzed the microbiomes of
               four dose-matched pairs of ``resolvers'' and ``pustule formers''
               whose inoculation sites were swabbed at multiple time points.
               Bacteria present on the skin were identified by amplification and
               pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Nonmetric multidimensional
               scaling (NMDS) using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between the
               preinfection microbiomes of infected sites showed that sites from
               the same volunteer clustered together and that pustule formers
               segregated from resolvers (P = 0.001, permutational multivariate
               analysis of variance [PERMANOVA]), suggesting that the
               preinfection microbiomes were associated with outcome. NMDS using
               Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of the endpoint samples showed that the
               pustule sites clustered together and were significantly different
               than the resolved sites (P = 0.001, PERMANOVA), suggesting that
               the microbiomes at the endpoint differed between the two groups.
               In addition to H. ducreyi, pustule-forming sites had a greater
               abundance of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Micrococcus,
               Corynebacterium, Paracoccus, and Staphylococcus species, whereas
               resolved sites had higher levels of Actinobacteria and
               Propionibacterium species. These results suggest that at
               baseline, resolvers and pustule formers have distinct skin
               bacterial communities which change in response to infection and
               the resultant immune response. IMPORTANCE: Human skin is home to
               a diverse community of microorganisms, collectively known as the
               skin microbiome. Some resident bacteria are thought to protect
               the skin from infection by outcompeting pathogens for resources
               or by priming the immune system's response to invaders. However,
               the influence of the skin microbiome on the susceptibility to or
               protection from infection has not been prospectively evaluated in
               humans. We characterized the skin microbiome before, during, and
               after experimental inoculation of the arm with Haemophilus
               ducreyi in matched volunteers who subsequently resolved the
               infection or formed abscesses. Our results suggest that the
               preinfection microbiomes of pustule formers and resolvers have
               distinct community structures which change in response to the
               progression of H. ducreyi infection to abscess formation.",

               stemming from high-dimensionality, non-normality, sparsity, and
               the compositional nature of microbiome data sets. A key tool in
               microbiome analysis is beta diversity, defined by the distances

              of contamination and inefficiencies, leading many investigators to
              employ low-throughput methods with minimal controls. We developed
              a new automated protocol, KatharoSeq (from the Greek katharos
              [clean]), that outperforms single-tube extractions while
              processing at least five times as fast. KatharoSeq incorporates
              positive and negative controls to reveal the whole bacterial
              community from inputs of as few as 50 cells and correctly
              identifies 90.6\% (standard error, 0.013\%) of the reads from 500
              cells. To demonstrate the broad utility of KatharoSeq, we
              performed 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenome analyses of the
              Jet Propulsion Laboratory spacecraft assembly facility (SAF; n =
              192, 96), 52 rooms of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU; n =
              388, 337), and an endangered-abalone-rearing facility (n = 192,
              123), obtaining spatially resolved, unique microbiomes
              reproducible across hundreds of samples. The SAF, our primary
              focus, contains 32 sOTUs (sub-OTUs, defined as exact sequence
              matches) and their inferred variants identified by the deblur
              algorithm, with four (Acinetobacter lwoffii, Paracoccus marcusii,
              Mycobacterium sp., and Novosphingobium) being present in >75\% of
              the samples. According to microbial spatial topography, the most
              abundant cleanroom contaminant, A. lwoffii, is related to human
              foot traffic exposure. In the NICU, we have been able to
              discriminate environmental exposure related to patient infectious
              disease, and in the abalone facility, we show that microbial
              communities reflect the marine environment rather than human
              input. Consequently, we demonstrate the feasibility and utility of
              large-scale, low-biomass metagenomic analyses using the KatharoSeq

              environments contain small quantities of microbial biomass and
              represent a niche that is often understudied because of technical
              constraints. Many studies that attempt to evaluate these
              low-biomass microbiome samples are riddled with erroneous results
              that are typically false positive signals obtained during the
              sampling process. We have investigated various low-biomass kits
              and methods to determine the limit of detection of these
              pipelines. Here we present KatharoSeq, a high-throughput protocol

              to 500 cells. We demonstrate the application of this method in

              across diverse areas of biology, with many benefiting from
              increased sample size. Although the cost of running
              next-generation sequencing instruments has dropped substantially
              over time, the cost of sample preparation methods has lagged
              behind. To counter this, researchers have adapted library
              miniaturization protocols and large sample pools to maximize the
              number of samples that can be prepared by a certain amount of
              reagents and sequenced in a single run. However, due to high
              variability of sample quality, over and underrepresentation of
              samples in a sequencing run has become a major issue in
              high-throughput sequencing. This leads to misinterpretation of
              results due to increased noise, and additional time and cost
              rerunning underrepresented samples. To overcome this problem, we
              present a normalization method that uses shallow iSeq sequencing
              to accurately inform pooling volumes based on read distribution.
              This method is superior to the widely used fluorometry methods,
              which cannot specifically target adapter-ligated molecules that
              contribute to sequencing output. Our normalization method not only
              quantifies adapter-ligated molecules but also allows normalization
              of feature space; for example, we can normalize to reads of
              interest such as non-ribosomal reads. As a result, this
              normalization method improves the efficiency of high-throughput
              next-generation sequencing by reducing noise and producing higher
              average reads per sample with more even sequencing depth.
              IMPORTANCE High-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) has
              significantly contributed to the field of genomics; however,
              further improvements can maximize the potential of this important
              tool. Uneven sequencing of samples in a multiplexed run is a
              common issue that leads to unexpected extra costs or low-quality
              data. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a normalization
              method based on read counts rather than library concentration.
              This method allows for an even distribution of features of
              interest across samples, improving the statistical power of data
              sets and preventing the financial loss associated with
              resequencing libraries. This method optimizes NGS, which already

               their relevance to environmental factors. This approach is
               independent of taxonomic classification, granting the possibility
               of maximal resolution of community composition, and organizes
               features into an accurate hierarchy using a phylogenomic tree.
               The outputs are suitable for contemporary analytical protocols
               for community ecology, differential abundance, and supervised
               learning while supporting phylogenetic methods, such as UniFrac

               metagenomics despite being prevalent in 16S rRNA gene amplicon
               studies. As demonstrated in two real-world case studies, the OGU
               method produces biologically meaningful patterns from microbiome
               data sets. Such patterns further remain detectable at very low
               metagenomic sequencing depths. Compared with taxonomic unit-based
               analyses implemented in currently adopted metagenomics tools, and
               the analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence variants, this
               method shows superiority in informing biologically relevant
               insights, including stronger correlation with body environment

               metagenomics studies. IMPORTANCE Shotgun metagenomics is a
               powerful, yet computationally challenging, technique compared to
               16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing for decoding the composition
               and structure of microbial communities. Current analyses of
               metagenomic data are primarily based on taxonomic classification,
               which is limited in feature resolution. To solve these
               challenges, we introduce operational genomic units (OGUs), which
               are the individual reference genomes derived from sequence
               alignment results, without further assigning them taxonomy. The
               OGU method advances current read-based metagenomics in two
               dimensions: (i) providing maximal resolution of community
               composition and (ii) permitting use of phylogeny-aware tools. Our
               analysis of real-world data sets shows that it is advantageous
               over currently adopted metagenomic analysis methods and the
               finest-grained 16S rRNA analysis methods in predicting biological
               traits. We thus propose the adoption of OGUs as an effective
               practice in metagenomic studies.",

              complex microbial communities that can be extremely dynamic across
              hosts, environments, and time points. However, managing
              acquisition, processing, and analysis of large numbers of samples
              poses many challenges, with cross-contamination being the biggest
              obstacle. Contamination complicates analysis and results in sample
              loss, leading to higher costs and constraints on mixed sample type
              study designs. While many researchers opt for 96-well plates for
              their workflows, these plates present a significant issue: the
              shared seal and weak separation between wells leads to
              well-to-well contamination. To address this concern, we propose an
              innovative high-throughput approach, termed as the Matrix method,
              which employs barcoded Matrix Tubes for sample acquisition. This
              method is complemented by a paired nucleic acid and metabolite
              extraction, utilizing 95\% (vol/vol) ethanol to stabilize
              microbial communities and as a solvent for extracting metabolites.
              Comparative analysis between conventional 96-well plate
              extractions and the Matrix method, measuring 16S rRNA gene levels
              via quantitative polymerase chain reaction, demonstrates a notable
              decrease in well-to-well contamination with the Matrix method.
              Metagenomics, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (16S), and
              untargeted metabolomics analysis via liquid chromatography-tandem
              mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) confirmed that the Matrix method
              recovers reproducible microbial and metabolite compositions that
              can distinguish between subjects. This advancement is critical for
              large-scale study design as it minimizes well-to-well
              contamination and technical variation, shortens processing times,
              and integrates with automated infrastructure for enhancing sample
              randomization and metadata generation. IMPORTANCE: Understanding
              dynamic microbial communities typically requires large-scale
              studies. However, handling large numbers of samples introduces
              many challenges, with cross-contamination being a major issue. It
              not only complicates analysis but also leads to sample loss and
              increased costs and restricts diverse study designs. The prevalent
              use of 96-well plates for nucleic acid and metabolite extractions
              exacerbates this problem due to their wells having little
              separation and being connected by a single plate seal. To address
              this, we propose a new strategy using barcoded Matrix Tubes,
              showing a significant reduction in cross-contamination compared to
              conventional plate-based approaches. Additionally, this method
              facilitates the extraction of both nucleic acids and metabolites
              from a single tubed sample, eliminating the need to collect
              separate aliquots for each extraction. This innovation improves
              large-scale study design by shortening processing times,
              simplifying analysis, facilitating metadata curation, and

               together, will greatly enhance the efficiency of common
               bioinformatics tasks while also facilitating incorporation of
               further optimized steps running on GPUs, FPGAs, or other
               architectures. We also note that a detailed exploration of
               available algorithms and pipeline components is an important step
               that should be taken before optimization of less efficient
               algorithms on advanced or nonstandard hardware. IMPORTANCE In
               shotgun metagenomics studies that seek to relate changes in
               microbial DNA across samples, processing the data on a computer
               often takes longer than obtaining the data from the sequencing
               instrument. Recently developed software packages that perform
               individual steps in the pipeline of data processing in principle
               offer speed advantages, but in practice they may contain pitfalls
               that prevent their use, for example, they may make approximations
               that introduce unacceptable errors in the data. Here, we show
               that differences in choices of these components can speed up
               overall data processing by 5-fold or more on the same hardware
               while maintaining a high degree of correctness, greatly reducing
               the time taken to interpret results. This is an important step
               for using the data in clinical settings, where the time taken to
               obtain the results may be critical for guiding treatment.",

               disease, inflammatory bowel disease and malnutrition. Sequencing
               and computational technologies, however, have been a limiting
               factor in performing dense time series analysis of the human
               microbiome. Here, we present the largest human microbiota time
               series analysis to date, covering two individuals at four body
               sites over 396 timepoints. RESULTS: We find that despite stable
               differences between body sites and individuals, there is
               pronounced variability in an individual’s microbiota across
               months, weeks and even days. Additionally, only a small fraction
               of the total taxa found within a single body site appear to be
               present across all time points, suggesting that no core temporal
               microbiome exists at high abundance (although some microbes may
               be present but drop below the detection threshold). Many more
               taxa appear to be persistent but non-permanent community members.

               communities found on and in the human body vary across
               individuals. What has largely been missing from previous studies
               is an understanding of how these communities vary over time
               within individuals. To the extent to which it has been
               considered, it is often assumed that temporal variability is
               negligible for healthy adults. Here we address this gap in
               understanding by profiling the forehead, gut (fecal), palm, and
               tongue microbial communities in 85 adults, weekly over 3 months.
               RESULTS: We found that skin (forehead and palm) varied most in
               the number of taxa present, whereas gut and tongue communities
               varied more in the relative abundances of taxa. Within each body
               habitat, there was a wide range of temporal variability across
               the study population, with some individuals harboring more
               variable communities than others. The best predictor of these
               differences in variability across individuals was microbial
               diversity; individuals with more diverse gut or tongue
               communities were more stable in composition than individuals with
               less diverse communities. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal sampling of a
               relatively large number of individuals allowed us to observe high
               levels of temporal variability in both diversity and community
               structure in all body habitats studied. These findings suggest
               that temporal dynamics may need to be considered when attempting
               to link changes in microbiome structure to changes in health
               status. Furthermore, our findings show that, not only is the
               composition of an individual's microbiome highly personalized,
               but their degree of temporal variability is also a personalized
               feature.",

               phylogenetic β-diversity metric, the adaptive Haar-like distance.
               This new metric assigns a weight to each internal node (i.e.,

               maternal factors that range from obesity to early feeding and
               breast milk composition. Animal studies suggest a role for human
               milk oligosaccharide (HMO), 2'-fucosyllactose (2'FL), on learning
               and memory, yet no human studies have examined its impact on
               infant cognitive development relative to other HMOs and maternal
               factors. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of 2'FL from breast
               milk feeding on infant cognitive development at 24 months of age
               relative to maternal obesity and breast milk feeding frequency.
               METHODS AND MATERIALS: Hispanic mother-infant pairs (N = 50) were
               recruited across the spectrum of pre-pregnancy BMI. Breast milk
               was collected at 1 and 6 months, and feedings/day were reported.
               Nineteen HMOs were analyzed using high-performance liquid
               chromatography, with initial interest in 2'FL. Infant cognitive
               development score was assessed with the Bayley-III Scale at 24
               months. Linear regressions were used for prediction, and
               bootstrapping to determine mediation by 2'FL. RESULTS: Maternal
               pre-pregnancy BMI was not related to feedings/day or HMOs, but
               predicted poorer infant cognitive development (β = -0.31, P =
               0.03). Feedings/day (β = 0.34) and 2'FL (β = 0.59) at 1 month
               predicted better infant cognitive development (both P≤ 0.01). The
               association of feedings/day with infant cognitive development was
               no longer significant after further adjustment for 2'FL
               (estimated mediation effect = 0.13, P = 0.04). There were no
               associations of feedings/day and 2'FL at 6 months with infant
               cognitive development. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that
               maternal factors influence infant cognitive development through
               multiple means. Though maternal obesity may be a separate
               negative influence, greater frequency of breast milk feeding at 1
               month contributed to infant cognitive development through greater
               exposure to 2'FL relative to other HMOs. The influence of 2'FL
               was not significant at 6 months, indicating that early exposure
               to 2'FL may be a critical temporal window for positively

               early years of life influences short- and long-term infant
               health. The aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate
               bacterial dynamics in the microbiome of preterm infants during
               tooth eruption. Methods: Saliva samples from normally delivered
               (n = 24) and preterm infants (n = 31) were collected 30 days
               after birth and after the eruption of two primary mandibular
               incisors. Based on Illumina MiSeq Sequencing of the 16S rRNA
               gene, the dynamic microbial changes of newborns at two-time
               points were investigated. Meanwhile, the Human Oral Microbiome
               Database was adopted for assigning taxonomy. Results: Using alpha
               and beta diversity analyses, different shift patterns of
               microbiome structures in preterm and healthy participants and
               bacterial diversity over time were observed. The relative
               abundance and shifts trend, along with the two lower primary
               central incisors eruption, of core oral flora varies in full-term
               and preterm groups, including Gemella spp., Rothia mucilaginosa,
               Veillonella atypica, etc. Several microorganisms colonize later
               in the oral microbiome development of premature babies, such as
               Gemella spp. In addition to teeth eruption, the growth of the
               saliva microbiome in preterm infants could be influenced by
               breastfeeding durations and birth weight. Conclusion: This study
               provided insights into how the oral microbiota changes during
               tooth eruption in preterm infants and how the colonization of the
               oral cavity with bacteria in preterm infants differs
               significantly from that in full-term infants.",

               found as colorful pigments in fruits and vegetables. At least 600
               carotenoids occur naturally, although about 20 of them, including
               β-carotene, α-carotene, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin,
               meso-zeaxanthin, and cryptoxanthin, are detectable in the human
               blood. They have distinct physiological and pathophysiological
               functions ranging from fetal development to adult homeostasis.
               β-carotene is a precursor of vitamin A that essentially functions
               in many biological processes including vision. The human macula
               lutea and eye lens are rich in lutein, zeaxanthin, and
               meso-zeaxanthin, collectively known as macular xanthophylls,
               which help maintain eye health and prevent ophthalmic diseases.
               Ocular carotenoids absorb light from the visible region (400-500
               nm wavelength), enabling them to protect the retina and lens from
               potential photochemical damage induced by light exposure. These
               natural antioxidants also aid in quenching free radicals produced
               by complex physiological reactions and, consequently, protect the
               eye from oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction,
               and inflammation. This review discusses the protective mechanisms
               of macular xanthophylls in preventing eye diseases such as
               cataract, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic
               retinopathy. Moreover, some preclinical animal studies and some

              the new millennium, a lot of new information has emerged regarding

              renewed knowledge on oral microbial community acquisition in the

              Throughout childhood, the oral microbial load increases, but the
              microbial diversity decreases. The initial colonizers are related
              to the type of delivery, personal relationships, and living
              environment. These first colonizers seem to condition the
              subsequent colonization, which will lead to more complex and
              stable ecosystems in adulthood. These early oral microbial
              communities, therefore, play a major role in the development of
              the adult oral microbiota and may represent a source of both
              pathogenic and protective microorganisms in a very early stage of
